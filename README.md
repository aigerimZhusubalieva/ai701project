**Abstract:** Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, affects millions globally, posing significant emotional and financial challenges for patients and caregivers. Emerging research highlights the critical role of the gut microbiome in influencing neurodegenerative processes through the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Alterations in gut microbial composition have been linked to AD pathology through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation. This project leverages gut microbiome data to predict AD by analyzing datasets from Turkey and Shanghai. Using advanced feature engineering techniques and machine learning models, microbial signatures associated with AD are identified. The results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive diagnostic methods and explore generalizable microbiome patterns across diverse populations, offering insights into personalized therapeutic strategies.


**Code usage:** This repo includes 4 Jupyter notebooks: _download_and_extract_ to load the data, extract, and perform data preprocessing. _feature_selection_ contains the implementation of our feature selection. _training_ where we carried out model training and evaluation. _statistical_analysis_ where the statistical significance of the selected features was carried out.
